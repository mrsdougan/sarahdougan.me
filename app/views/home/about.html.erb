						I'm a twenty-something year old designer and developer born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. Previously I lived in San Francisco where I worked with various startups and clients on a wide range of websites, UIs and product design. I gained a lot of experience there and got a real feel for the 'startup culture'. Fueled by tea and puppy cuddles I am currently settled in Amsterdam with my husband and our kitties and dogs.

					<p>I've always loved art and design for as far back as I remember I'd love making things look pretty and drawing, then as I got older I realised it was something I could take further. Designing is something more than a job or hobby for me, it's something I love doing daily. From web design to character design, I love exploring and working with all types of design and graphics.</p>

					<p>Other than web design I enjoy lots of cycling (yay flat Netherlands), drawing, tea, painting, motorbikes, travelling, tattoos and all sorts of crafts.</p> -->
